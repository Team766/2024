/**
 * Context is the framework's representation of a single thread of execution.
 *
 * We may want to have multiple procedures running at the same time on a robot.
 * For example, the robot could be raising an arm mechanism while also driving.
 * Each of those procedures would have a separate Context. Each of those
 * procedures may call other procedures directly; those procedures would share
 * the same Context. Each Context can only be running a single procedure at a
 * time. If a procedure wants to call multiple other procedures at the same
 * time, it has to create new Contexts for them (using the {@link #startAsync}
 * method).
 *
 * Use the Context instance passed to your procedure whenever you want your
 * procedure to wait for something. For example, to have your procedure pause
 * for a certain amount of time, call context.waitForSeconds. Multiple Contexts
 * run at the same time using cooperative multitasking, which means procedures
 * have to explicitly indicate when another Context should be allowed to run.
 * Using Context's wait* methods will allow other Contexts to run while this one
 * is waiting. If your procedure will run for a while without needing to wait
 * (this often happens if your procedure has a while loop), then it should
 * periodically call context.yield() (for example, at the start of each
 * iteration of the while loop) to still allow other Contexts to run.
 *
 * This cooperative multitasking paradigm is used by the framework to ensure
 * that only one Context is actually running at a time, which allows us to avoid
 * needing to deal with concurrency issues like data race conditions. Even
 * though only one Context is running at once, it's still incredibly helpful to
 * express the code using this separate-threads-of-execution paradigm, as it
 * allows each procedure to be written in procedural style
 * (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_programming "procedural languages
 * model execution of the program as a sequence of imperative commands"), rather
 * than as state machines or in continuation-passing style, which can be much
 * more complicated to reason about, especially for new programmers.
