/**
 * {@link RuleEngine}s manage and process a set of {@link Rule}s.  Subclasses should add rules via
 * {@link #addRule(com.team766.framework3.Rule.Builder)}.  {@link Rule}s have an implicit priority based on insertion order - the first {@link Rule} to be added is highest priority, etc.
 *
 * Callers should then call {@link #run} once per iteration.  Each call to {@link #run} evaluates each of the contained {@link Rule}s, firing the associated {@link Procedure}
 * {@link Supplier}s when {@link Rule}s are NEWLY triggering, are CONTINUING to trigger, or are FINISHED triggering.
 *
 * The {@link RuleEngine} also pays attention to the {@link Mechanism}s that these {@link Procedure}s reserve.
 * For a {@link Rule} to trigger, its predicate must be satisfied -- and, the {@link Mechanism}s the corresponding {@link Procedure} would reserve
 * must not be in use or about to be in use from a higher priority {@link Rule}.
