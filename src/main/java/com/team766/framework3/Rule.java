/**
 * Rule to be evaluated in the {@link RuleEngine}.  Rules contain a
 * "predicate" that will be evaluated in each call to {@link RuleEngine#run}, typically
 * in an OperatorInterface loop or Display (LED lights, etc) loop.  The Rule keeps track of
 * when the predicate starts triggering, continues triggering, and has finished triggering, via
 * a {@link TriggerType}, eg when a driver or boxop starts pressing a button, continues holding down
 * the button, and releases the button.  Each Rule has optional {@link Procedure} actions
 * for each of these trigger types, which the {@link RuleEngine} will consider running, after checking
 * if higher priority rules have reserved the same {@link Mechanism}s that the candidate rule would use.
 *
 * {@link Rule}s are always created and used with a {@link RuleEngine}.  Typically creation would be:
 *
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 *   public class MyRules extends RuleEngine {
 *     public MyRules() {
 *       // add rule to spin up the shooter when the boxop presses the right trigger on the gamepad
 *       rules.add(Rule.create("spin up shooter", gamepad.getButton(InputConstants.XBOX_RT)).
 *         withNewlyTriggeringProcedure(() -> new ShooterSpin(shooter)));
 *       ...
 *     }
 * }
 * </pre>
