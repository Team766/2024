 * pull a game piece in via {@link #in}, release a contained game piece via {@link #out}, or stop

 * While the Intake does not maintain any state as to whether or not it contains a game piece,
 * it does have different modes of operation based on what kind of game piece it is prepared to
 * intake or outtake.  This is because the motor must spin in opposite directions to intake cubes
